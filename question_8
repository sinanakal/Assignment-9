/*Alejandro have started learning java, he knows what you know about ifs and strings. 
 * He has a large number of text emails, going through all of them will take a lot of time.
 *  To save time he will only read the emails that refer to him by name. 
 *  He wants to write a program that gets a string (the email) and 
 *  determines if his name "Alejandro" appears in that string. if so it will output "read this mail" else it will output "don't read".

Sample Output:

     input: "dear alejandro.....alot of text"

     output: "read this mail"

     input: "thunder blaz is the best drink in the galaxy..."

     output: "don't read"

     input: "subject: important project, Alejandro we refer to you this ...."

     output: "read this mail"
